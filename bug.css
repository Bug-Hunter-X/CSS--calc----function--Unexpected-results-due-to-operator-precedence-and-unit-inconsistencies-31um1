The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20%);` might not do what you expect, leading to unexpected layout issues. The percentage is calculated relative to the *containing block's width*, not the element's current width.
